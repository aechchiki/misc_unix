### Description:

This is a repository where to stock bits of customizable code, especially oneliners, useful for text processing. 
The repository is organized in scripts, one per language type (awk, sed, perl). 


### Code:

Temporarily, the documentation is in form of comments within the code itself and in the readme. Every one liner has
a header to describe its functionality. Full-text search the repository for specific needs.
Better documentation upcoming (TODO).
